## Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/raulmar0/nextjs-ghost-template.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name
npm install
```

First of all, use this line in `next.config.js` if using Github pages with a custom domain
```
module.exports = {
  basePath: '/your-repo-name',
}
```
else use
```
module.exports = nextConfig
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```
npm run dev
```

## Customization

You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate. Please change the following file:

- General styles in `./styles/globals.scss`
- Blogpost styles in `./styles/globals.scss` under the `.post-` classes
- Favicon `./public`
- Main config file `./utils/AppConfig.ts`
  - Ghost url and version
  - Site name, title and description
  - Projects
  - Social media links

## How to add API KEY

- In the code `CONTENT_API_KEY` is referenced as a process.env variable
- In the yml file we add this before the `jobs` section
  ``` 
  env:
  CONTENT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONTENT_API_KEY }}
  ```
- And finally we add the CONTENT_API_KEY in our [Github GUI as a secret](https://docs.github.com/es/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)

## Deploy to production

In order to deploy your static site run:

```
$ npm run export
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `_static` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.
